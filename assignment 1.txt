Assignment #1: Implementing Numerical Methods in Python Tasks: For each of the questions, you should implement the solution as a Python code. 
1) Solve the following system of linear equations using a Gauss Elimination Method 
2x -2y= -6 
x -y + z = 1 
3y -2z = -5 
2) Solve the following system of linear equations using an LU Decomposition Method 
x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 
4x1 + 3x2 -x3= 6 
3x1 + 5x2 + 3x3 = 4 
3) Solve the following system of linear equations using Gauss elimination with scaled row pivoting 
x1 -x2 + 2x3 + x4 = 1 
3x1 + 2x2 + x3 + 4x4 = 1 
5x1 + 8x2 + 6x3 + 3x4 = 1 
4x1 + 2x2 + 5x3 + 3x4 = -1 
4) Solve the following system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition 
2x1 -2x2 -3x3 = 7 
-2x1 + 5x2 + 4x3 = -12 
-3x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 = -12
